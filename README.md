This was a fun three days.

These were a messy three days.

Rest in peace, code quality.

Seriously I've never written worse code, this is a step below the usual "hobby project don't care"-level. Oh well it's done.

I can't regret the still-there programmer art of the finish or falling rocks.

I can't regret the pretty bad pixel art I ended up with.

I can't regret the fact that I didn't add as many aesthetic things as I'd hoped.

I can't regret.

I finished something for once.
