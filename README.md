So I might actually continue this. Probably not by a lot because I'd need to rewrite that single-day mess but I could at least fix the issues...

Using Unity 2018.3.0f2.

This was originally for [the 3rd Touhou fangame jam](https://itch.io/jam/touhou-jam-3), see [the state of the repo](https://github.com/Atrufulgium/TH-Fan-Game-Jam-3-Entry/tree/aab981611a096c3556ae67998f1af9d667b64421) (at commit [aab9816](https://github.com/Atrufulgium/TH-Fan-Game-Jam-3-Entry/commit/aab981611a096c3556ae67998f1af9d667b64421)) for that version.
